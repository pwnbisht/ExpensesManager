## About
Expense Manager is a Django REST API application that helps users manage their expenses among a group of friends or collaborators. The application allows users to create expenses, split them among participants, and track balances.

## Features
- **Expense Creation:** Users can create expenses with details such as the payer, amount, expense type, and participants.
- **Expense Splitting:** Expenses can be split equally, based on exact amounts, or percentage shares among participants.
- **Validation:** The application validates expense amounts and split details to ensure accuracy.
- **Balances:** Users can view their balances with other participants, showing who owes whom and how much.
